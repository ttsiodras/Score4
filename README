This is a simple implementation of Score4 (also called Connect4).
The goal is to form horizontal, vertical or diagonal series of
4 of your chips (green). The computer tries to do the same, using
red chips.

The GNU-licensed code includes F#, OCaml, C# and C++ implementations, 
using both functional and imperative styles of coding.

Precompiled windows binary of the game is under:

    make playSimple
        to play a console game of score4

    make benchmark
        to benchmark the 4 languages (F#/C#/OCaml/C++)

3. The "make play" controls:
